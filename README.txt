NOTES TO TA: PLEASE READ

Note for the live Google Maps: 
1. SSL is not working so it will not auto detect location, but it works on local host.
2. Clicking on the marker will lead you to the location's info page, (check URL), but the page display does not refresh. I suspect this is a React problem.
